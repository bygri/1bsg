# Youth Trial Inquiry

At 1st Blackheath Scout Group, we offer a free 4 week trial for prospective
Joeys, Cubs, Scouts and Venturers. Use the form below to contact the Group
to organise your trial.

For more information on the different age sections and when they meet,
[see the home page](/).

Note: Please do not come to a meeting without making contact first, as
we are often away from the Scout Hall.
