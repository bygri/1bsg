# Join 1st&nbsp;Blackheath Scouts

Scouting is about fun, friends, adventure and so much more. Scouting encourages young people to develop
at their own pace by leading, assisting and participating in a broad range of activities and
adventures designed to spark their curiosity and inspire growth.

## Scouting in the Upper Blue Mountains

At 1st Blackheath, we pursue an active, outdoors program and encourage our youth members
to discover what they are capable of, while under the watchful eye of trained Scout Leaders.
When not at our Scout Hall, we are off hiking or camping in our beautiful natural
environment.

Our members represent all the towns in the upper mountains including Blackheath, Katoomba,
Megalong, Wentworth Falls, Leura, Mt Victoria and Hartley.

We'd love to welcome your child for a free 3 week trial, to see what
Scouting is all about and to meet the kids and Leaders at 1st Blackheath.
Please [submit an enquiry]({{ urls.enquiry_url}}) to book in your trial.
