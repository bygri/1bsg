# Join 1st&nbsp;Blackheath Scouts

Scouting is about fun, friends, adventure and so much more. Scouting encourages young people to develop
at their own pace by leading, assisting and participating in a broad range of activities and
adventures designed to spark their curiosity and inspire growth.

We'd love to welcome your child at the Scout Hall for a free 3 week trial, to see what
Scouting is all about and to meet the kids and Leaders at 1st Blackheath.
Please [submit an enquiry]({{ urls.enquiry_url}}) to book in your trial.
