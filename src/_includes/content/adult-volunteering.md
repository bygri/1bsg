## Adult Volunteering

At 1st Blackheath we always welcome adult involvement, whether it's as a parent helper,
a fundraising volunteer, a member of our Support Committee or a uniformed Leader.

Becoming a Leader at 1st Blackheath is one of the most fun and rewarding ways
to help outâ€”and it's easier than you think. Full training is provided for free,
and the Leader team (more like a family) is friendly and supportive. Why not
consider trying out as an Assistant Leader?

If you'd like to find out more about helping in any capacity,
**Group Leader Bagheera (Toby)** would love to hear from you.
