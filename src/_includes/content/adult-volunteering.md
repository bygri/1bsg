## Adult Volunteering

At 1st Blackheath we always welcome adult involvement, whether it's as a parent helper,
a fundraising volunteer, a member of our Support Committee or a uniformed Leader.

If you'd like to find out more about helping in any capacity, we'd love to hear from you.

**Group Leader** Bagheera (Toby)
