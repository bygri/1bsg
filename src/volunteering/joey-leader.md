## Joey Leader

Leaders are the lifeblood of our organisation, doing their part to support
thousands of children and young people to grow and develop through adventure.

Our Leaders are responsible for helping to devise and deliver programs that
support young people in reaching their potential. Not only do they play a
vital role in empowering young people to strive for their best as they
progress through their Scouting journey, but Leaders themselves develop
a variety of transferable skills, meet new people and discover adventure
for themselves, all while having loads of fun.

No prior Scouting experience is necessary to become a Leader. In fact, all
Leaders undergo training on all aspects of youth leadership, program
planning, safety and other requirements to ensure they have the knowledge,
skills and confidence to support our youth members and work with other
volunteers. They are also given resources of program ideas to help them get
started on their Scouting career.

Joey Leaders are required to:

- Attend Joey meetings on Wednesday afternoons during school terms
- Participate in a quarterly Leaders meeting
- Work with other Leaders and youth members to plan and lead Group
  activities, such as hiking or camping trips, which take place a few
  weekends during the year
- Complete compulsory training.

### Child safety in Scouts

Child safety is our number one priority at Scouts NSW. Therefore, along
with training in child safety, all Leaders are thoroughly screened, undergo
a Police Check and must hold a valid, verified Working With Children Check
to ensure the safety of our youth members.
